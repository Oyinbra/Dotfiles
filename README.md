This is where I keep all of the various dotfiles for different programs I use. If you'd like an in-depth list of all the software and hardware I use on a daily basis, see the Uses page on my website.

Feel free to copy any of the dotfiles or scripts you find here, as much of it is just copied from others' dotfiles. Please do not try to copy my entire setup, as it is very disorganized and specific to my needs. Instead, try copying bits and pieces as you put together your own dotfiles unique to you.
